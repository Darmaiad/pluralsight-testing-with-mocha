# Testing JavaScript for Node.js with Mocha (Pluralsight) 

The project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Testing JavaScript for Node.js with Mocha](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mocha-javascript-testing-nodejs) by [Jonathan Mills](https://github.com/jonathanfmills).

## Installation
* Assuming you have `npm` & `node.js` installed, you can either clone or download the repository. 
* Navigate to the folder that you/was created. Then select one of the two folders. Each contains a sub-project.
* After you select one sub project, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. 
* You can run the tests in each sub-project by running `npm test`.
* Additionally the sub-project `module-6-gitChecker` contains the script `npm run coverage` to run the tests with the code covrage tool [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/).
 
## Description
This is a simple project, merely coding along the instructor and heavy commenting on the code. The one major change I performed is that I updated the packages to their latest version.
